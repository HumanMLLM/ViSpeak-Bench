It is implemented based on the Transformer architecture (a deep learning neural network architecture) that can handle and parallelize long-distance dependencies.\n\nThe working principle of the GPT model can be divided into two stages: pre-training and fine-tuning.\n\nIn the pre-training stage, the GPT model is trained using a large amount of unlabeled text data. It learns the statistical rules of the language by predicting the missing words in the given context, which is known as 'masked language modeling'. During pre-training, the model learns to capture language information such as vocabulary, grammar, sentence structure, and context.\n\nIn the fine-tuning stage, the GPT model is trained using a small amount of labeled data for specific tasks, allowing it to adapt to specific application scenarios, such as question-answering systems, text generation, text classification, etc. This process involves fine-tuning the model weights to better suit the new tasks.\n\nWhen processing text, the GPT model utilizes the self-attention mechanism, meaning it can learn the correlations between different elements in the input sequence and use this to weight and combine information from different parts. This mechanism allows the model to handle long-distance dependencies, for example, when generating text, it can decide the next content to generate based on the context information.\n\nIn conclusion, through the processes of pre-training and fine-tuning, the GPT model learns the statistical rules of the language and can handle long-distance dependencies through the self-attention mechanism to generate coherent, grammatically correct natural language text.",

Set strong passwords: Passwords should contain at least 8 characters, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. Avoid using easily guessed passwords such as birthdays, phone numbers, or consecutive numbers.\n\n2. Change passwords regularly: Passwords should be changed regularly, preferably every three months. Do not reuse old passwords.\n\n3. Do not share passwords: Passwords are personal and should not be shared with others or recorded anywhere. If information needs to be shared, use other authorization methods, such as adding others as collaborators to shared folders.\n\n4. Enable multi-factor authentication: Use multi-factor authentication, such as fingerprint recognition or SMS verification codes, to increase account security.\n\n5. Beware of phishing: Do not enter passwords on insecure websites or in emails, and be cautious of phishing attacks.\n\n6. Be aware of security in public places: When using computers or mobile devices in public places, pay attention to your surroundings to avoid others glimpsing your password input.\n\nBy following the points above, you can properly use secure passwords and effectively protect personal information and company data.

Set goals: Identify what you want to accomplish, break them down into long-term and short-term goals, and prioritize them.\n\n2. Make a plan: Develop a realistic schedule, break each goal into smaller tasks, and allocate time for each task. Use calendars, to-do lists, or other tools to help you track your progress.\n\n3. Share and combine resources: Consider the resources you can utilize, such as manpower, funds, technology, etc., and share or combine them with others for better results.\n\n4. Avoid procrastination: Don't put off tasks until the last minute, as this will increase stress and affect efficiency. Methods to overcome procrastination include setting deadlines and rewarding yourself for completing tasks.\n\n5. Stay focused: Maintain focus while completing tasks and avoid distractions. You can turn off your phone, disable email notifications, or use focus software to help you stay attentive.\n\n6. Rest and relax: Work also requires appropriate breaks and relaxation, allowing your brain and body to recover. Plan your rest time daily and relax during weekends or holidays.\n\n7. Regular evaluation: Regularly assess your time management and adjust your plans. Summarize past experiences, learn from successes and failures, and plan for the future.\n\nThrough effective time management strategies",

Design the chart style and layout: After selecting the visualization tools, you can start designing the style and layout of the charts according to the overall style and requirements of the website. This step is very important because a reasonable layout and excellent visual effects can enhance user experience.\n\n4. Integrate data and generate charts: After the design is completed, you can start integrating the data into the website and call the visualization tools to generate the charts. Usually, this step requires writing some code to achieve data reading and chart generation.\n\n5. Optimization and debugging: After the charts are generated, some optimization and debugging work needs to be done to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data visualization. Additionally, adjustments need to be made based on user feedback to improve the quality of data visualization.\n\nIn summary, providing website data visualization solutions requires determining data sources and types, selecting suitable visualization tools, designing the chart style and layout, integrating data and generating charts, as well as performing optimization and debugging.

The return result of the function is stored in a variable named `result`. Finally, we use an `if` statement to check the value of the result variable and print the corresponding message.

Definition\nSystem software refers to software that manages, controls, and maintains computer hardware and software resources and provides support for other software. Its main purpose is to provide a basic environment and services for the computer system, such as operating systems, drivers, etc.\nOn the other hand, application software refers to software developed to perform specific tasks or solve specific problems for users. It is directly oriented towards end-users and is used to complete specific work or entertainment tasks, such as text editors, games, audio/video players, etc.\n\n2. Function\nThe main function of system software is to provide a runtime environment and basic support for other software, such as memory management, file system management, process management, device drivers, etc. It plays the role of a fundamental framework in the computer system.\nThe functionalities of application software vary greatly depending on the purpose of the developers and the needs of the target user group. It provides user-friendly interfaces and operational processes, directly serving end-users.\n\n3. Dependency\nApplication software usually relies on the support of system software to function properly, whereas system software does not depend on application software. For instance, application software needs the interfaces and services provided by the operating system to access hardware devices and the file system, while the operating system itself can function without the support of application software.\n\n4. Developers\nSystem software is usually developed by professional software development companies or organizations. For example, operating systems are generally developed by large companies such as Microsoft, Apple, and Google.\nApplication software can be developed by any developer, including individual developers, small companies, and large companies.",

Data Preparation: First, we need to prepare a large amount of text data for training the GPT model. This data typically includes a large corpus and dictionary, which can be obtained online or constructed by ourselves.\n\n2. Model Training: Use the prepared data to train the GPT model so that it can learn how to understand and generate text. During the training process, GPT continuously learns language structures and contextual relationships to gradually improve its natural language understanding capability.\n\n3. Task Customization: After completing the basic training, we can fine-tune the GPT model according to specific task requirements to better accomplish particular tasks. For example, a question-and-answer system can be trained by providing a large number of question-and-answer pairs, or a summarization system can be trained by providing a large amount of summary texts.\n\n4. Application Implementation: Once the model is trained and customized, we can apply the GPT model to real-world scenarios to solve various complex tasks involving natural language understanding. For example, by integrating with a chatbot, GPT can be used for natural language question-answering, or by building a text summarization system, GPT can be used for automatic summarization, etc.\n\nIn summary, GPT can solve complex tasks like natural language understanding through extensive data training and model fine-tuning, with a wide",

If not, move on to the next pair of elements, i.e., the second and third elements.\n2. Continue this process until you reach the end of the array. At this point, the largest element in the array will have bubbled up to the end of the array.\n3. Now, repeat the above process, but this time ignore the last element since it is already sorted. Continue until only one element is left, which is by default sorted.\n4. The entire array is now sorted in ascending order.\n\nHere is the code implementation of bubble sort in python:\n\n```\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n    return arr\n```\n\nTo use this function, you can pass your array of numbers as an argument to the function. For example:\n\n```\nmy_array = [2, 5, 1, 8, 4]\nsorted_array = bubble_sort(my_array)\n```\n\nThis will return the array [1, 2, 4, 5, 8], which is the sorted version of the input array.",

Non-relational databases do not have fixed data structures, storing data as key-value pairs, documents, column families, or graphs, supporting more flexible data models.\n\n- Query Language: Relational databases typically use Structured Query Language (SQL), which is very powerful and standardized. Non-relational databases do not have a standardized query language, and each database has its own API, so data retrieval and manipulation methods vary by database. However, with the development of non-relational databases, some NoSQL databases are beginning to support SQL-like languages.\n\n- Transaction Support: Relational databases usually provide high consistency in transaction processing, ensuring data integrity and consistency. Non-relational databases vary in their support for transactions; some do not support transactions at all, while others only support single-document transactions. Increasingly, more NoSQL databases are starting to provide support for multi-document transactions.\n\n- Scalability: As data volume grows, relational databases handle it through vertical scaling (adding hardware resources), but this method has certain limitations. Non-relational databases typically use horizontal scaling, distributing data across multiple nodes, thus offering better scalability.\n\n- Application Scenarios: Relational databases are more suitable for complex data storage structures requiring strict data",

Adjust hyperparameters: For example, learning rate, batch size, and training steps are hyperparameters that may need careful tuning. Try different combinations of hyperparameters to find the optimal solution.\n\n2. Choose an appropriate tokenizer: Tokenizers are used to split the text into tokens and convert them into numbers acceptable by the model. Splitting the text into too large or too small tokens can affect the model's performance, so choose an appropriate tokenizer.\n\n3. Provide sufficient data: When training the GPT model, provide a sufficient amount of high-quality training data. The data should have the same context or goal to train a relatively accurate model.\n\n4. Fine-tune with a pre-trained model: If your task is the same as or similar to the training task of a pre-trained model, you can fine-tune with the pre-trained model. This can save time and computational resources while achieving better results.\n\n5. Monitor training progress: Be sure to monitor the training progress of the model. Use a validation set to check the model's performance and adjust hyperparameters accordingly. If you find the model is overfitting, you can stop training early.\n\nIn summary, the best ways to maximize the results of a GPT model include adjusting hyperparameters, choosing an appropriate tokenizer, providing sufficient data, fine-tuning with a pre-trained model, and monitoring training progress.",

In the second step, we find the smallest value 4 from the unsorted sequence [5, 8, 6, 4] and place it at the end of the sorted sequence, producing a new sorted sequence [3, 4] and an unsorted sequence [5, 8, 6].\n\n3. In the third step, we find the smallest value 5 from the unsorted sequence [5, 8, 6] and place it at the end of the sorted sequence, producing a new sorted sequence [3, 4, 5] and an unsorted sequence [8, 6].\n\n4. In the fourth step, we find the smallest value 6 from the unsorted sequence [8, 6] and place it at the end of the sorted sequence, producing a new sorted sequence [3, 4, 5, 6] and an unsorted sequence [8].\n\n5. In the final step, since there is only one element left, there is no need to select anymore, and it can be directly placed.",

It standardizes data so that it meets certain statistical standards and eliminates differences in dimensionality between data. This method is commonly used in the fields of machine learning and data mining, aiming to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of models.\n\nNormalization covers many different data types, including numerical data, text data, and time series data, among others. The ways of normalization vary depending on the data type.\n\nFor numerical data, common normalization methods include min-max normalization, Z-score normalization, and decimal scaling normalization. These methods are based on statistical principles and involve linearly transforming the raw data to map it onto a fixed range (e.g., [0, 1]), eliminating differences in dimensionality between data.\n\nFor text data, normalization usually involves processing raw text data into a standardized format to facilitate further analysis. For instance, text normalization often includes converting case, removing punctuation and special characters, tokenization, and removing stop words.\n\nFor time series data, normalization typically involves processing the raw time series data by removing factors such as seasonality, trends, and cycles to eliminate non-random fluctuations in the data. This process is sometimes referred to as \"detrending.\"\n\nIn summary, normalization is an important method for data preprocessing. It eliminates differences in dimensionality between data and improves the accuracy and effectiveness of models. Normalization can be applied to different data types, with varying methods for each type.",

Text Collection: The first step is to collect the text data to be analyzed, which can be achieved by scraping comments, posts, and feedback from online websites, social media platforms, or other sources.\n\n2. Data Preprocessing: Before analyzing the text, data cleaning and preprocessing are required. This includes removing extraneous characters, deleting stop words, normalizing the text, and performing stemming and lemmatization.\n\n3. Feature Extraction: Next, features need to be extracted from the processed text, which will be used to train the classifier. Features to consider might include words used in the text, word frequency, n-grams, and grammatical structures.\n\n4. Model Training: Based on the extracted features, an algorithm is selected to train a sentiment analysis classifier. This algorithm could be a Naive Bayes classifier, a support vector machine, or another commonly used machine learning algorithm.\n\n5. Classification: The trained classifier will be used to classify new data. The classification results can be positive, negative, or neutral, and of course, can be further divided into more categories.\n\n6. Visualization: Once the classification results are obtained, they can be presented through data visualization. Tools like word clouds, bar charts, and pie charts can be used to present and interpret the data.\n\nSentiment analysis is a complex and continuously evolving field, and different application scenarios may have different analysis processes and methods.

Model Selection: Choose the appropriate machine learning algorithm based on the problem type, data characteristics, and the actual application scenario. For example, for classification problems, models such as decision trees, support vector machines, or neural networks can be used; for regression problems, models like linear regression, ridge regression, or neural networks can be employed.\n\n3. Model Training: Train the model using labeled data. Different models may have different training methods or processes, but they generally involve adjusting and optimizing the model parameters by maximizing the model's fit to the data or minimizing the model's prediction error.\n\n4. Model Evaluation: After training, the model's performance needs to be evaluated to check whether it meets the expected results. Common evaluation methods include cross-validation and leave-one-out. During the evaluation process, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be used to measure the model's performance.\n\n5. Model Adjustment: If the model's performance does not meet expectations after evaluation, adjustments can be made. Adjustment methods may include changing the model, tuning model parameters, adding feature engineering, etc.\n\nThrough the above steps, you can train a machine learning model using labeled data, evaluate it, and make necessary adjustments to improve the model's performance.",

Topic Selection and Planning: Before starting to write, determine the topic of the article, then clarify the writing goals and target audience. Next, gather relevant materials and organize them. Develop a writing outline or framework to clearly list the structure of the article and the core content of each part.\n\n2. Draft Writing: Follow your previous writing outline and start writing the first draft of the article. At this point, don't be too concerned with the accuracy of the language and the perfection of the article, but let the writing flow naturally and record as many ideas as possible.\n\n3. Revision and Proofreading: After completing the first draft, revise and proofread the article. Check if the structure of the article is reasonable, ensure the content is coherent, and correct language and grammar errors. You can ask a friend, teacher, or parent to help with proofreading; listening to others' opinions can help identify issues you haven't noticed.\n\n4. Further Revision and Polishing: Based on the proofreading feedback, revise the article again. At this point, focus on polishing sentences and enhancing the appeal of the text. Check if the word choices are accurate and appropriate, if the sentences are smooth, and if the punctuation is correct.\n\n5. Finalization and Publication: After completing the revisions and polishing, you can finalize the article.",

In this approach, AI systems perform operations using a predefined knowledge base and can reason and compute according to preset rules (If-Then rules). The advantage of symbolic AI is that it can solve formal logical reasoning problems well, but it may face difficulties when dealing with vague, inconsistent, or even contradictory concepts and situations.\n\nMachine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that refers to enabling computer systems to learn from data and then make predictions or decisions based on that learning. Machine learning is a data-driven approach; it does not require a predefined knowledge base or rules but rather discovers hidden patterns by learning from large amounts of data and then reasons based on these patterns.\n\nIn simple terms, symbolic AI relies on rules, prior knowledge, logical reasoning, and programming languages to implement, emphasizing rational thinking for decision-making and modeling by computers. In contrast, machine learning emphasizes data-driven approaches such as neural networks, deep learning, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning to enable computers to learn and generalize from data independently.\n\nThe main differences between the two are as follows:\n1. Source of knowledge and rules: Symbolic AI requires a predefined knowledge base and rules, whereas machine learning obtains models and rules through learning from large amounts of data.\n2.

Below are the three main steps used in data preprocessing:\n\n1. Data Cleaning: This is the first step in data preprocessing, involving the removal of irrelevant data, proper data classification, identification and removal of duplicate data, filling in missing values, and detecting and correcting errors in the data. The purpose of this step is to eliminate noise in the data and improve data quality.\n\n2. Data Transformation: This step involves standardizing, normalizing, and scaling the data so that it meets the requirements of statistical learning methods. Additionally, encoding techniques (such as one-hot encoding) can be used to convert categorical variables into numerical variables. The purpose of data transformation is to enhance data usability for further analysis.\n\n3. Data Dimensionality Reduction: Dimensionality reduction refers to reducing the number of dimensions in the dataset to better present the data structure and relationships. Methods for dimensionality reduction include feature selection (removing irrelevant features) and feature extraction (generating new features by combining multiple features). Dimensionality reduction can improve computational efficiency, enhance model predictive capability, and help eliminate noise and redundant information in the data.\n\nAbove is a brief introduction to the three main steps in data preprocessing. Through these steps, raw data can be made clearer, more standardized, and easier to use for building machine learning models and conducting data analysis.",

Determine Filing Status and Forms: Each country and region has different filing statuses and corresponding tax forms. Determine your filing status and download the appropriate tax forms.\n\n3. Fill Out Tax Forms: Complete the tax forms based on the collected documents and guidelines. Ensure that all numbers are accurately filled in and all necessary sections are completed.\n\n4. Calculate Tax Due: According to relevant laws, calculate the amount of tax you owe. If you're eligible for any deductions or credits, also calculate them at this stage.\n\n5. Submit Tax Forms: Once you have completed and checked your forms, you should submit the tax forms and related documents to the tax authorities according to local regulations.\n\n6. Pay Taxes: If you owe taxes, you should make the payment within the specified deadline and by the prescribed payment method.\n\n7. Handle Tax Refunds and Payments: If your prepaid taxes exceed the amount due, you can apply for a tax refund; conversely, if your prepaid taxes are less than the amount due, you need to pay the shortfall. The tax authorities will review your submitted tax forms and related documents to determine your final refund or payment amount.\n\nThe tax filing process may vary depending on the individual's situation.",

If they are in the wrong order, swap their positions until all elements are arranged in ascending or descending order.\n\nHere is the process of using the bubble sort algorithm to sort numbers in an array in ascending order:\n\n1. Traverse the entire array, starting from the first element, and compare the current element with the next element.\n2. If the current element is greater than the next element, swap the positions of these two elements.\n3. Continue to traverse the array until the end of the array.\n4. At this point, the largest element has been moved to the last position of the array.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4, ignoring already sorted elements each time, until the entire array is sorted.\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the array. Therefore, for larger arrays, the bubble sort algorithm may not be very efficient. However, its simplicity makes it a commonly used sorting algorithm.\n\nBelow is an example of the bubble sort algorithm implemented in Python:\n\n```\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(0, n-1-i):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis function accepts an array as input and returns a sorted array.",

Data Collection and Preparation: First, you need to collect a large amount of text data, preferably with labeled sentiment tags (such as positive, negative, or neutral), which will be used to train the model. If you don't have labeled data, you can use rules with a sentiment dictionary to automatically assign tags, but note that the accuracy of these tags may be affected. Data preparation also includes preprocessing the text, such as removing stop words, punctuation, converting to lowercase, etc.\n\n2. Choose a Model: Sentiment analysis can be done using various machine learning methods, including Naive Bayes classifier, support vector machines, random forest, neural networks, and so on. You can try different algorithms, compare their performance, and choose the model that suits your data and needs.\n\n3. Feature Extraction: Text data needs to be converted into numerical features that the model can process. Common text feature extraction methods include Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, etc.\n\n4. Train the Model: Use the training set of the data to train your chosen model. During the training process, you can adjust the model parameters to obtain better performance.\n\n5. Evaluate the Model: Use the test set of the data to evaluate the model's performance. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, recall, F1 score, etc. If the model performs poorly, further adjust the model parameters or replace the model.\n\n6. Use the Model: Once the model is trained, it can be used for sentiment analysis of new text data. When processing new data, use the same preprocessing as the training data and",

Set IP address: If using a static IP address, manually assign a unique IP address to the computer or device. If using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), the IP address can be obtained automatically.\n\n3. Set subnet mask: The subnet mask is used to determine other devices on the same network as your device. If using DHCP, the subnet mask is usually set automatically. If using a static IP address, it needs to be set manually.\n\n4. Set default gateway: The default gateway is the gateway for the computer or device to communicate with external networks. If using DHCP, the default gateway is usually set automatically. If using a static IP address, it needs to be set manually.\n\n5. Configure DNS: The Domain Name System (DNS) is a service that converts website addresses into IP addresses. You can manually set the DNS server address, or use the DNS servers provided by your network provider or a third party.\n\n6. Test network connection: After completing the network configuration, test the network connection to ensure the configuration is correct. This can be done by opening a web browser and accessing a webpage, or by using the ping command to test the connection to a specific IP address.\n\nThese are the basic steps of network configuration, and specific operations may vary depending on the operating system and network equipment.",

Below is a simple example demonstrating how to create a linked list in C++.\n\n```c++\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Linked list node contains a data element and a pointer to the next node\nstruct Node {\n    int data;\n    Node* next;\n};\n\n// Create a linked list: returns the head pointer of the linked list\nNode* createLinkedList(int* arr, int n) {\n    if (n == 0) return nullptr;\n    \n    Node *head = new Node {arr[0], nullptr}; // Create the head node\n    Node *cur = head;\n    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n        cur->next = new Node{arr[i], nullptr}; // Create the next node\n        cur = cur->next; // Move to the next node\n    }\n    return head;\n}\n\nvoid printLinkedList(Node* head) {\n    Node* cur = head;\n    while (cur != nullptr) {\n        cout << cur->data << \" \";\n        cur = cur->next;\n    }\n    cout << endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(int);\n\n    Node *head = createLinkedList(arr, n);\n    printLinkedList(head);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn the code above, we define a structure named `Node`, which contains an integer data element `data` and a pointer to the next node `next`. Then, we define a function `createLinkedList` to create the linked list. The function accepts an array and an integer `n`, representing the data elements of the linked list and the length of the list, respectively. We first create a head node and use a pointer `cur` to point to the head node. Then, we iterate over the array, dynamically creating new nodes using the `new` operator and adding them to the end of the list. Finally, we return the pointer to the head node, which is the head pointer of the linked list.\n\nThe above code also includes a `print",

This is usually done in order to give one party an unfair advantage over the other in elections.\n\nUser: What is the impact of gerrymandering on our democracy?\nAI: Gerrymandering can undermine democracy by manipulating district boundaries to skew representation in favor of one group or party. This can result in elected officials who do not reflect the true will of the voters, and may make it more difficult to hold politicians accountable or have competitive elections.\n\nUser: How can gerrymandering be addressed?\nAI: There are a few ways to address gerrymandering. One solution is the use of independent redistricting commissions, which are made up of non-partisan members who draw district lines without political bias. Another solution is the use of algorithmic redistricting, which uses computer programs to draw district lines based on demographic data without political bias.\n\nUser: Thank you for your explanation.

Determine what information you want to convey through the visualization and what you want the audience to learn from it.\n\n2. Collect and organize data: Once the goal is determined, you need to collect and organize data to prepare for visualization. This may involve gathering raw data, cleaning away unnecessary and inaccurate data, and formatting data for analysis.\n\n3. Choose an appropriate chart type: Based on the information you wish to convey and the needs of the audience, select the most suitable type of chart to present the data. Common chart types include bar charts, line charts, pie charts, scatter plots, histograms, and heat maps.\n\n4. Design the visualization: After selecting the chart type, you need to design the details of the visualization including colors, text annotations, fonts, and chart size to ensure the visualization is vivid and easy to understand.\n\n5. Create and draw the visualization: Based on the design, use data visualization tools or software to create and draw the visualization. This may involve writing code, using spreadsheet software, or drawing software.\n\n6. Review and refine: Once the visualization is completed, review and modify it to ensure it is accurate, complete, and meets the objectives. This may include re-checking the data, making minor adjustments to the chart, and modifying annotations and text.\n\nThe entire process may need to be repeated until a satisfactory visualization is completed.",

The origin of cloud computing technology can be traced back to the early development of computer networks in the 1960s.\n\nThe initial concept of cloud computing originated in 1961, when American computer scientist John McCarthy proposed the idea of 'computer time-sharing.' This concept was to allow multiple users to share computer resources simultaneously by dividing the resources into multiple virtual areas. In the 1970s, IBM introduced the Virtual Machine (VM) operating system, enabling multiple users to use the same hardware, realizing the concept of resource sharing.\n\nWith the development of computer and communication technologies, as well as the application of the internet and the World Wide Web, cloud computing technology began to germinate and rapidly flourish. By the 1990s, telecommunication companies started to introduce Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology, which allowed more efficient use of network resources through shared networks.\n\n2006 was a significant milestone in the development of cloud computing. In that year, Amazon launched its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service, providing virtual server services. This marked the transition of cloud computing from concept to commercial practice.\n\nSubsequently, tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and others launched their own cloud computing solutions. Now, cloud computing has become a mainstream direction of technological development, with broad application prospects. Many enterprises and organizations are using",
